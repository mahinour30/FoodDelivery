#### -Restaurant Screen: when you choose a restaurant the app navigates to this screen to show the menu and you can now add items to the cart.
#### -Order Screen: when you press order it navigates to this screen to view the map and the distance from the driver and you and you could call the driver or press cancel to go back.
